            So how did the classical Latin become so incoherent? According to McClintock, a 15th century typesetter
            likely scrambled part of Cicero's De Finibus in order to provide placeholder text to mockup various fonts
            for a type specimen book.

            It's difficult to find examples of lorem ipsum in use before Letraset made it popular as a dummy text in the
            1960s, although McClintock says he remembers coming across the lorem ipsum passage in a book of old metal
            type samples. So far he hasn't relocated where he once saw the passage, but the popularity of Cicero in the
            15th century supports the theory that the filler text has been used for centuries.

            And anyways, as Cecil Adams reasoned, “[Do you really] think graphic arts supply houses were hiring classics
            scholars in the 1960s?” Perhaps. But it seems reasonable to imagine that there was a version in use far
            before the age of Letraset.
